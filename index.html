    <section>
      <h2 class="section-heading">General Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Derapse’s <i>Antigone</i> is a modern adaptation of Sophocles’ 
        Greek Tragedy of the same title, with a focus on the complexities of immigration within families. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The story is focused on the Hipponomes, refugees in Quebec who fled from Kabylia in the event of their parents’ demise. On the surface, their family seems to be a close-knit, happy one, all of them enjoying each other’s company despite the tumultuous event that brought them here. 
        However, the family quickly runs into conflict when Polynice’s life of crime leads to the demise of his older brother and the splintering of the family as a whole. 
        Antigone, the heroine of the story, similar to the play, takes matters into her own hands and attempts to keep family unity—getting arrested instead of Polynice to prevent his deportation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Antigone (2019)</i> takes the original Greek tragedy and simultaneously maintains the themes of struggle and strife—at least within 
        immigrant families in Quebec—while offering themes of hope and family unity despite that struggle.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-heading">Derapse and the Origins of Antigone</h2>
      <p>
        Sophie Derapse, a Canadian director, scenarist, and producer, directed Antigone among many other works. 
        She is also known for creating <i>The Amina Profile</i> and narrative feature films such as <i>Missing Victor Pellerin</i>. 
        Her work often deals with more contemporary issues, ones that typically involve representation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The shooting of Fredy Villanueva is a more direct inspiration for the contents of the film, as it parallels the real-life police brutality that immigrants have to suffer through in Quebec. 
        Villanueva, a Honduran immigrant, was shot and killed by a Montreal police officer after an altercation with the police, even though he had no criminal record nor any affiliation with gangs. 
        This is reflected in Étéocle’s death in Antigone, leading to protests by Montreal citizens.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="section-heading">Art of “Show, Don’t Tell”</h2>
      <p>
        Antigone is excellent at the concept of showing rather than telling what is going on within the scene. 
        In the film, there are plenty of occasions where the film has to display the effect of Antigone’s actions on the greater society—the protests, the videos, and the general consensus of her actions in attempting to save her brother. 
        However, rather than having a character mention the broad influence her actions have on Quebec society, it shows it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The development of short ‘video’ transitions and internet reactions aptly displays the effects that Antigone’s actions have on the world around her and how large of an impact they then have on her family. This is a much more powerful way of displaying the impacts that such incidents have on society and how they can lead to change.
      </p>
      <p>
        The popularity of Antigone’s arrest, combined with the subsequent support of her words, in following her “heart,” portrays the growth of identification of issues such as immigration and police brutality in society.
      </p>
      <p>
        This modern inclusion in a meaningful way acts as a great display of character influence. Rather than feeling like Antigone is influencing her world, it shows how she influences it—a far cry from other films that feel like more of a show of the world than a story.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-heading">Issues on Suspension of Disbelief</h2>
      <p>
        Suspension of disbelief is a sort of contract a creator of the story makes with the audience that consumes the media, acting as a voluntary choice that the audience makes to ignore the logic of reality and accept the world that the writer creates. 
        This does not only apply to purely functional stories; stories that are set in our reality still have some fictional aspects that audiences have to forgo when watching or reading them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to suspension of disbelief, however, there must be some form of consistency within the story itself. 
        The fictional elements must follow the rules of the stories, character personalities, and the other elements of the writer’s world so that they do not become plot holes/inconsistencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Antigone, there are certain issues with the plot. How she managed to swap with her brother in the visitation cell, when many countries, including France, will have cameras within those rooms, makes the story feel fake. The court system, and Antigone’s lack of understanding the depth of trouble she would be in when facing the law (despite her intelligence), act as a character inconsistency with her seeming naiveness. In Quebec, when they are so clearly not treated the same as citizens, it is shocking to see her shocked when the judicial system is harsh with her, despite having no criminal record.
      </p>
      <p>
        This does not take away from what the story is telling, however. In fact, despite the various issues immigrants have to go through living in other countries, there is still plenty of hope for a better life. The incredulous elements do take away from the story somewhat, but not enough to make the message fall completely flat to audiences.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-heading">Recontextualizing the Old to the New</h2>
      <p>
        The film is very recent, coming out in 2019, and has a lot of ties with many things happening today. There are many opinions in regards to the issues of immigrants and the treatment of those who move to countries, which makes this movie still applicable today. The Black Lives Matter movement and current immigration issues are some issues similar to the ones shown in the movie. A lot of the topic, at least when it comes to BLM, is police brutality against African Americans in general. It is unsurprising that, with unrelenting issues on the topic of immigration and police brutality incidents, that a movie like this would come out recently.
      </p>
      <p>
        The debate on whether or not the movie is applicable to Sophocles’ play is varied: there are many points about the movie that go against it. For one, it cannot be considered a Greek tragedy in the typical sense; no one died by the end of the movie and it inspired hope. Other than the names, the ties to it in story and in content are very unlike each other. With little connection, it is a wonder why this movie received this title, rather than one of its own.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those seeking the Greek tragedy, perhaps it is best to look for other renditions. While the story portrays the issues of those a society considers different from them, it is not the retelling that includes the important elements of the original Antigone. If you would like to know a part of the immigrant experience, this story is decent.
      </p>
