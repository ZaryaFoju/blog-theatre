    <section>
      <h2 class="section-heading">General Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Derapse’s <i>Antigone</i> is a modern adaptation of Sophocles’ 
        Greek Tragedy of the same title, with a focus on the complexities of immigration within families. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The story is focused on the Hipponomes, refugees in Quebec who fled from Kabylia in the event of their parents’ demise. On the surface, their family seems to be a close-knit, happy one, all of them enjoying each other’s company despite the tumultuous event that brought them here. 
        However, the family quickly runs into conflict when Polynice’s life of crime leads to the demise of his older brother and the splintering of the family as a whole. 
        Antigone, the heroine of the story, similar to the play, takes matters into her own hands and attempts to keep family unity—getting arrested instead of Polynice to prevent his deportation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Antigone (2019)</i> takes the original Greek tragedy and simultaneously maintains the themes of struggle and strife—at least within 
        immigrant families in Quebec—while offering themes of hope and family unity despite that struggle.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="section-heading">Derapse and the Origins of Antigone</h2>
      <p>
        Sophie Derapse, a Canadian director, scenarist, and producer, directed Antigone among many other works. 
        She is also known for creating <i>The Amina Profile</i> and narrative feature films such as <i>Missing Victor Pellerin</i>. 
        Her work often deals with more contemporary issues, ones that typically involve representation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The original Greek tragedy from which the movie title and themes were inspired loosely inspires the actual contents of the movie itself. 
        Only the character name and the title of the film have been formed from the play that Sophocles developed. 
        In fact, much of the movie was inspired by a real-life event and existing attitudes toward immigrants in Quebec.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shooting of Fredy Villanueva is a more direct inspiration for the contents of the film, as it parallels the real-life police brutality that immigrants have to suffer through in Quebec. 
        Villanueva, a Honduran immigrant, was shot and killed by a Montreal police officer after an altercation with the police, even though he had no criminal record nor any affiliation with gangs. 
        This is reflected in Étéocle’s death in Antigone, leading to protests by Montreal citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Antigone attempts to capture a woman’s defiance of the laws for something they consider more important, in the case of Sophocles’ Antigone, while showing the issues with immigrant families and police (and other aspects of the government).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="section-heading">Art of “Show, Don’t Tell”</h2>
      <p>
        Antigone is excellent at the concept of showing rather than telling what is going on within the scene. 
        In the film, there are plenty of occasions where the film has to display the effect of Antigone’s actions on the greater society—the protests, the videos, and the general consensus of her actions in attempting to save her brother. 
        However, rather than having a character mention the broad influence her actions have on Quebec society, it shows it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is shown in the transitions between scenes and the reactions online to the videos that the general population has access to from the news. 
        This is a much more powerful way of displaying the impacts that such incidents have on society and how they can lead to change.
      </p>
      <p>
        The popularity of Antigone’s arrest, combined with the subsequent support of her words, in following her “heart,” portrays the growth of identification of issues such as immigration and police brutality in society.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides that, family interaction with the Hipponomes shows a close family and explains the lengths that Antigone is willing to go to protect that closeness. 
        Following the death of the eldest son, that same protectiveness for the family grew to a head as she took Polynice’s place, forgoing her academic and even romantic future with Hémon to keep her family from splintering.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="section-heading">Issues on Suspension of Disbelief</h2>
      <p>
        Suspension of disbelief is a sort of contract a creator of the story makes with the audience that consumes the media, acting as a voluntary choice that the audience makes to ignore the logic of reality and accept the world that the writer creates. 
        This does not only apply to purely functional stories; stories that are set in our reality still have some fictional aspects that audiences have to forgo when watching or reading them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to suspension of disbelief, however, there must be some form of consistency within the story itself. 
        The fictional elements must follow the rules of the stories, character personalities, and the other elements of the writer’s world so that they do not become plot holes/inconsistencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Antigone, there are certain issues with the plot. How she managed to swap with her brother in the visitation cell, when many countries, including France, will have cameras within those rooms, makes the story feel fake. 
        The court system, and Antigone’s lack of understanding the depth of trouble she would be in when facing the law (despite her intelligence/understanding of the place they are in), act as a character inconsistency with her seeming naive. 
        In Quebec, when they are so clearly not treated the same as citizens, it is shocking to see her shocked when the judicial system is harsh with her, despite having no criminal record.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond Antigone as a character, the means by which she was able to protect her brother was unbelievable. 
        Not only the way she got him out, but also the way her sister, Ismène, somehow had contact with someone who could send Polynice to the States. 
        With more explanations to explain character beliefs (and accomplishments), many of the issues with plot holes can be resolved.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="section-heading">Recontextualizing the Old to the New</h2>
      <p>
        The film is very recent, coming out in 2019, and has a lot of ties with many things happening today. 
        There are many opinions in regards to the issues of immigrants and the treatment of those who move to countries, which makes this movie still applicable today. 
        The Black Lives Matter movement and current immigration issues are some issues similar to the ones shown in the movie.
      </p>
      <p>
        While its ties to Sophocles’ play can be debated, the message around individual action that may go against laws in favor of your own beliefs is still clear in both. 
        The original Antigone buried her brother from her own choices, while the Antigone of the film protected her brother by taking the fall for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this, there are thoughts around not only societal issues but ones those surrounding free will. 
        And, while the movie may not be a one-for-one interpretation of the tragedy, and with its consistencies, there is still value in seeing it for the exploration of free will within a society of set rules and procedures (particularly regarding family).
